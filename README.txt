Game Description:

Starting with an empty grid of dots, players take turns, adding a single horizontal or vertical line between two unjoined adjacent dots. A player who completes the fourth side of a 1Ã—1 box earns one point and takes another turn. The points are recorded by colored squares: blue for player 1 and red for player 2. The game ends when no more lines can be placed. The winner of the game is the player with the most points.

Enjoy and good luck against the hard computer!
